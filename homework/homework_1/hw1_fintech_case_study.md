## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Varo

* When was the company incorporated?
2015 

* Who are the founders of the company?
Colin Walsh and Kolya Klymenko in San Francisco

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Spent many years inside the banking system (American Banker). Recognized that the world was changing and banks were not keeping up with the consumers. Solving trust issues between consumers and financial customers. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Partnered with Bancorp Bank to supply the "backbone" of Varo's banking services. Varo applied for licensure to operate as bank and discontinued its partnership with Varo on October 1, 2020. Pushed to gain a banking charter with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) [OCC](https://occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2020/nr-occ-2020-99.html). 


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Provide an alternative to traditional banks for younger earners (Wikipedia.org). Banking is done on their app platform and not on a website. One of the many *neobanks* that aim to take on the traditional retail banking sector. Trying to solve the "trust" issue between consumers and their financial institutions. Does not charge fees. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Word of mouth and referrals for new customers. Using SM for acquiring new users. Predominantly of users in the Millenial and Gen Z age groups. Not rich users between $40,000 and $80,000 in yearly income. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Varo currently uses the standard technology stacks of Front-end and Back-end development. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Retail banking sector. Existing players in the sector include megabanks such as JPMorgan Chaes, Bank of America to regional banks and credit unions. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
The industry has moved to online and mobile banking. As more consumers pay for goods and services through online or mobile platforms, banks have had to shift their products and services to meet that demand. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Other startup neobanks such as Ally [Ally](https://www.ally.com) or N26 [N26](https://n26.com/en-us) 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The biggest business impact of Varo has been growing its consumer base. It provides services to customers who traditionally have been left out of the retail banking sector. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Typically companies in this domain use increase in customer growth and assets under management (AUM) as a metric of growth. For Varo, both its customer base and AUM are growing. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Varo sucessfully received its banking charter on August 1, 2020. This is ahead of its FinTech peers that have to partner with existing banking corporations to provide chartered and insured banking services. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
 They should offer competitive loans for customers and non-customers. So far Varo does not offer loan products which is something other FinTech companies do (e.g. LendingClub [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com)). 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Loans are assets for the creditor. By issuing loans to customers and non-customers at competitive rates, they increase their brand awareness and business revenue. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
To offer competitive rates, Varo could use "Artificial Intelligence" to determine the size, rate, and term of the loan. While this technology is still being tested and would need to be reviewed by a human for compliance, it would reduce bias and inefficiency of the traditional loan officer/agent. It could also create data that can be used to provide further tailoring of the loans. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Artificial Intelligence is already being used in the banking sector. Products such as Mint by Intuit [Mint](https://mint.intuit.com) to Erica by Bank of America [Erica](https://promo.bankofamerica.com/erica/) use machine learning algorithms of customer data to provide insights into spending patterns and provide notices (e.g. "Upcoming Phone Bill").
